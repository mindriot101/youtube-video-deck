Come join the fun, ask questions, comment, and participate in the live chat!\n\nThis week we'll be exploring setting up cluster auth with a combination of GitHub, Dex (from CoreOS/Red Hat) and Heptio Gangway.  We'll also mix in a little Contour and Cert Manager.  The end result will be a secure auth framework as a building block for a multi-team cluster.\n\nTimestamps for the episode\n\n[06:24] News from Around the Community - k8s 1.11, Ark .9\n[14:05] https://aws.amazon.com/eks/\n[20:43] https://github.com/negz/kuberos\n[21:01] https://medium.com/@mrbobbytables/kubernetes-day-2-operations-authn-authz-with-oidc-and-a-little-help-from-keycloak-de4ea1bdbbe \n[22:14] https://github.com/appscode/guard\n[24:07] Joe will be covering adding github authentication to a kubernetes cluster in this episode using openid with dex.\n[00:24] Let's start configuring and theory-crafting \n[28:22] A primer of how does OAuth works \n[53:53] Setting up an OAuth in github\n[1:00:19] Jim Angel asks \"Do you think Dex will die out as RH merges Tectonic, Dex's main driving force, with OpenShift (since OpenShift already has auth using OCP cli + poor Dex documentation)?\"\n[01:18:44] Application is stood up and working\n[01:23:40] The server= line is empty!\n[01:25:55] Logged in, and Joe can't `get pods` because ....

We'll look at the current security model of the Kubernetes dashboard and explore using an authenticating proxy to secure any internal facing web service.\n\nLinks:\n* Files from the episode: https://gist.github.com/jbeda/53a7c6c81359054eacc1608f5211150c\n* Images for title cards from Unspash.

Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Ask questions, comment and help decide where things go.\n\nThis week we will be exploring monitoring with Prometheus. Joe hasn't used Prometheus before (but has used similar systems inside of Google).  We'll install it and try to get some simple metrics connected.
